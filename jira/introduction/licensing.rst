Cloud Transition
================
.. warning:: Atlassian is making changes to server and Data Center products, including the end of sale for new server licenses on February 2, 2021 and the end of support for server on February 2, 2024. https://www.atlassian.com/migration/journey-to-cloud

For server:

    * End of sale for new licenses: To focus on delivering a world-class cloud experience, we will stop selling new licenses for our server offerings and apps.
    * Three years of maintenance: If you have existing server licenses, you can continue to purchase maintenance and support for your licenses for up to three years.
    * Updates to future pricing: To ensure the continued security and maintenance of our server platform, we will increase the price of maintenance for existing server licenses.

For Data Center:

* The future of Data Center: If you aren’t ready to move to cloud, we'll continue to offer our self-managed enterprise edition, Data Center. In addition to continued investment in new features, we’ll look to make using cloud and Data Center together easier for you and your users through a more unified administration experience and improved integrations between the two offerings.
* Updates to future pricing: To reflect these investments and accelerate further innovation, we will increase the price of our Data Center subscriptions.
