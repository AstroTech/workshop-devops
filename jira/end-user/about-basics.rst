Manifesto for Agile Software Development
----------------------------------------
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
