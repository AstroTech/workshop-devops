Bosh
----
BOSH is an open source tool chain for release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services. Itâ€™s the default deployment and management platform for Cloud Foundry operators.

BOSH installs and updates software packages on large numbers of VMs over many IaaS providers with the absolute minimum of configuration changes.

CF Release
----------
CF-Release is the BOSH release repository for the Cloud Foundry platform. To deploy Cloud Foundry, start with cf-release, build a custom manifest for your deployment, and let BOSH take over from there.
